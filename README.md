# BOOS Core
BOOS Core is an object-oriented core for small embedded systems. The core is written in C++ programming language and can be used into small microcontrollers with limited resources. BOOS Core has a hardware independent application program interface which allows porting user source codes easily if hardware environment is changed. The core object model is built with a root class of classes' hierarchy and gets the best aspects of object-oriented approach.
